    Have you tried
    
    1) Selecting "alternate driver" during the Vista installation and installing the Intel SATA driver from the dell drivers cd (copy it to a usb stick that you can plug in during installation)?
    2) Changing the hard drive interface from AHCI to standard?

    "Or at least I could have installed Linux on the machine."
    
    Why can't you install linux on it? Dell sells the M1330 with Ubuntu.

    If this was my machine I would definately install linux. Of course its not mine. Its my wife's who is a tech writer and prefers windows.
    
    We did try uninstalling AHCI, I guess the annoying thing is that after all the time Dell should have had it figured out. It is their hardware after all.

I'll never buy a dell again. My wife shopped for a computer and chose the Dell M1330 last December. Around Feburary the hard drive failed. After replacing the hard drive and reinstalling Windows Vista the machine was unstable. We've had two technicians to come out to repair it.  We've sent it to the Depot. We've spent 20 hours working on this thing.  It is still failing. We've asked  for a new computer.  They say that they've replaced so much hardware that it is literally a new computer.  That's not the point.  Obviously they are missing something.  These machines are working fine from the factory but can't handle a simple Vista reinstall.  I'm not the only one with these problems with these machines.

I'm sure this is part of the Vista madness that is going on. However If I had purchased a mac that I could dual boot I'm sure that apple would have made things right. They would have refunded my money or given me a different machine.  Or at least I could have installed Linux on the machine.

The customer service is horrible. We've spent more time repairing, reinstalling, using the computer and then it failing that Dell should have worked with us. But they refused too.

Advice. If you do buy a machine and it starts acting up within 2 months of purchase then suspend the payment on your credit card until its fixed.
