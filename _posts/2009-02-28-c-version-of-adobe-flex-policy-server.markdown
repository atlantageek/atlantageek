  content: Thanks a lot. I was trying to do the same thing for a embedded server that I was connecting to from silverlight. I will have to modify the output a bit to work with silverlight but that should be trivial. I will try it out and let you know.

Here is a rewrite of the adobe flex policy server written in C.

<a href="http://www.atlantageek.com/?attachment_id=74" rel="attachment wp-att-74" title="FlexPolicyServer">FlexPolicyServer</a>

This is useful if you are adding a flex based web interface to an embedded system (something running openwrt). You can use this policy server instead of the ones written in perl and python.
