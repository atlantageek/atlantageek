   <title>DVRs for over the air TV</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;DVRs for over the air TV&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of cable service is something that is totally unrelated to their content.  The settop box is a great convience. The emergence of MSO provided DVRs has added a lot of value to their service. So if you really do want to cut the cord its time to consider how are you going to replace that $10/month leased settop box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of options. The grand-daddy of them  all is Tivo (Yes theyâ€™re still in business.) Tivo and ReplayTV(and they are not) invented the DVR business.  However Tivo is notorious for being expensive. Not just for the initial price ($149-349) but also the monthly charge $15/month.  You can also get a lifetime account for $500. (Thats a 3 year payback).&lt;br/&gt;
Used Tivos with lifetime memberships can be a good deal off of ebay. You can pickup a series 2 Tivo (OK 8 years old) with a lifetime account for $100. But it should work well. The newer Tivos do more than TV though.  They do netflix, amazon and other stuff thats kind of cool if you dont have a smart tv or smart dvd player. But The monthly fee is what you were trying to get away from when you cut the cable cord.  Tivo really needs to rethink their target market.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Raspberry PI and metageek Wi Spy web interface</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2013/04/21/raspberry-pi-and-metageek-wi-spy-web-interface/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2013/04/21/raspberry-pi-and-metageek-wi-spy-web-interface</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Included file 'JB/setup' not found in _includes directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what is it.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a web interface to a metageek spectrum analyzer that runs on a wi-spy. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj9u6VtkM3Y&quot;&gt;short video&lt;/a&gt; demostrating an early version of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/jj9u6VtkM3Y&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Currently there are markers and the beginning of a heatmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's the problem.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to monitor your wi-fi signal over long periods of time without tying up your laptop.  With wi-spy's costing upware of $500 and raspberry PI costing in the $40 range it seems like a small investment to free your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I dont like installing specialized software on our laptops anymore.  To be it just hogs the system unnecessarily. I tend to prefer webapps over PC apps because they work well whether Im on my work map, home Linux machine or Tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by connecting the Raspberry PI to the metageek wispy and with a little node.js code I now have a spectrum analyzer appliance I can connect to whenever I want to see the status of the spectrum.  This device could even be mounted in an area to monitor signal over time for a site survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So how is it done.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atlantageek/websocketsa&quot;&gt;github here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading you need to build the version of spectools that is in the repository.  The executable you need is call spectools_red.
* ./configure
* make spectool_red&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now run spectool_red as root.  This application copies data from wispy and copies it to the in memory redis database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next switch to the spectrum_analyzer screen and startup app.js with:
node app.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will start the web server.  If all is working well you will need to point the web browser to the raspberryPI's address port 8000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version has markers and a heat map.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why multi-field indexes in postgresql still matter.</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2013/02/08/multi-index-postgresql/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-08T13:49:51-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2013/02/08/multi-index-postgresql</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Included file 'JB/setup' not found in _includes directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why wouldn't it.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 8.1 postgresql includes the concept of a bitmap heap. A bitmap heap as implemented in postgresql is an array/matrix of bits stored in ram with each cell representing a record in the table being queried. Using the conditions included in the query the cell for each record is activated or deactivated. to show that these records should be included in the result of the query's search.  At the end of the query the bitmap heap is what determines wich records will be shown.  This bitmap can be built by scanning different indexes based on the query criteria
Compare this to how simpler databases like mysql work. In mysql only a single index is used for each table in each query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's try this with a basic database.  Below is a list of sales records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;SALES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# |Product|Date      |Store|Count|
1 |laptop |2-05-2013 |ST1  |10   |
2 |laptop |2-06-2013 |ST1  |20   |
3 |laptop |2-07-2013 |ST1  |30   |
4 |laptop |2-05-2013 |ST2  |20   |
5 |laptop |2-06-2013 |ST2  |30   |
6 |laptop |2-07-2013 |ST2  |10   |
7 |laptop |2-05-2013 |ST3  |20   |
8 |laptop |2-06-2013 |ST3  |30   |
9 |laptop |2-07-2013 |ST3  |10   |
10|phone  |2-05-2013 |ST1  |10   |
11|phone  |2-06-2013 |ST1  |20   |
12|phone  |2-07-2013 |ST1  |30   |
13|phone  |2-05-2013 |ST2  |20   |
14|phone  |2-06-2013 |ST2  |30   |
15|phone  |2-07-2013 |ST2  |10   |
16|phone  |2-05-2013 |ST3  |20   |
17|phone  |2-06-2013 |ST3  |30   |
18|phone  |2-07-2013 |ST3  |10   |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the following query:
select count(*) from sales where product = 'laptop' and Date &gt; '02-06-2013' order by Date
To keep from accessing records that do not fit the query then both product and date must be in the same index. If the queries are very ad hoc then multiple indexes possibly of each combination would need to be created. And these indexes would have large records because 2 or 3 attributes would be included.  And if you included a fourth attribute then you will soon hit 7-8 indexes to cover every combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now compare this to the postgresql approach
Instead you would create a single attribute index for each searchable criteria. Then for each condition in the where portion of the query it will fill in the bitmap array.&lt;br/&gt;
So for the above query here are the two results of the index query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;product = laptop
Record Positions:    1 |2 |3 | 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18
product = 'laptop' :  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
Date &amp;gt; '02-07-2013':  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  1
AND Operation      :  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the combined bitmap the system knows which records to pull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is faster than a scan and more efficient than a large number of indexes.  However it is still not as fast as a combined index. based on product and date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So consider a different scenario.  So far you have created an index on every attribute on your mult-tenant application. You sale your application to corporate offices that include multiple stores.  So rarely do you have a query that does not have some sort of store criteria. You may even have considered partitioning your application by groups of stores to improve your performance. Before you do this consider a different alternative.  For all your single attribute indexes prefix the store ID. You will still use the bitmap heap when doing searches but when building the bitmap heap you will filter your queries to a greater extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take away from this is that the single attribute indexes are good to have in your database but that does not mean that that is the only type of indexing you need.  For slow queries combined indexes could be faster.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>R Tutorial part 1</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2013/01/20/r-tutorial-part-1/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-20T13:49:51-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2013/01/20/r-tutorial-part-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Included file 'JB/setup' not found in _includes directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this tutorial is to:
* Provide a solid but concise tutorial on the R programming language from a beginners perspective
* Show why R's existence makes sense as opposed to being a library in a different language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some gotchas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some items to rember about R
* Everything is a Vector (kind of like an array). Even scalar values are single item Vectors.
* Vectors start with an index 1 instead of '0' like every other language in the world.
* Assignments are done with &amp;lt;- and not = .  so 'x&amp;lt;-4' is the way of assigning 4 to x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats enough for now.  Now let's start learning R&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Running example code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you already installed R then start the R console.  On mac and linux you just type 'R' and on windows I'm sure there is an icon to click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a
block quote
OK?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we continue on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rocking ltree on postgresql</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2012/10/25/rocking-ltree-on-postgresql/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-25T22:46:21-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2012/10/25/rocking-ltree-on-postgresql</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Postgresql 9.1 Now ships with a module called ltree. This is a cool postgresql that allows you to model hierarchies in you database and leverages the GIST indexing mechanism built into postgres.
Assume you are modeling several organizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CREATE TABLE orgs (path ltree);
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top');
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA');
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division1');
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division1.storeZ');
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division1.storeY');
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division2');
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division2.storeV');
INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division2.storeW')
CREATE INDEX path_gist_idx ON test USING gist(path);
CREATE INDEX path_idx ON test USING btree(path);
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now you can do some interesting queries such as Give me all the rstores in Division1
&lt;code&gt;
select * from orgs where path ~ &quot;Top.OrgA.Division1.*&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
or give me all the stores (where the path is at least 4 items long)
&lt;code&gt;
select * from orgs where path ~ Top.{4}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another neat feature that Postgresql gives you but mysql doesn't&lt;/p&gt;

To adjust this you have do delete or move the ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1 file in your datadir.  Then start the database.
So step-by-step
1. stop mysql
2. modify my.cnf, specifically the changes you want to make to innodb_log_file_size

   <title>Accessing a non standard database in rails</title>

   <updated>2009-08-15T20:32:24-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2009/08/15/accessing-a-non-standard-database-in-rails</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Normally in rails you would configure a production, test and development database in the database.yml file.  If some of your rails data comes from a different database you can configure it in database.yml as well.  For example I wanted two rails applications to synchronize their databases occassionally.
To do this I created a remote db in one of the rails application that looks like this in database.yml:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remotedb:
  adapter: mysql
  database: remote_rails
  username: remote_user
  password: remote_pwd
  host: remote server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the script that is executed by script/runner I did the following to access the new db.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;admin_cfg=Rails::Configuration.new.database_configuration[&quot;remotedb&quot;]
if remote_cfg.nil?
  raise &quot;admindb is not configured.  Cannot pull data from admin db.&quot;
end
dbh = Mysql.real_connect(remote_cfg[&quot;host&quot;], remote_cfg[&quot;username&quot;], remote_cfg[&quot;password&quot;], remote_cfg[&quot;database&quot;])
Now use ruby's mysql library to work with dbh&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2009/04/01/radio-buttons-act-more-like-combobox</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Normally what I would do with radio buttons is to look for a click event and set variables accordingly.&amp;nbsp; However there is another way to use radio button if you are operating more in a 'filling out a form' approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;mx:Application xmlns:mx=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml&quot; layout=&quot;absolute&quot;&gt;
&lt;mx:Label text=&quot;{'Radio Selected :'+ rg.selectedValue.toString()}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;mx:RadioButtonGroup id=&quot;rg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;mx:RadioButton x=&quot;10&quot; y=&quot;26&quot; value=&quot;RADIO 1&quot; selected=&quot;true&quot; label=&quot;radio1&quot; groupName=&quot;rg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;mx:RadioButton x=&quot;10&quot; y=&quot;52&quot; value=&quot;RADIO 2&quot; label=&quot;radio2&quot; groupName=&quot;rg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/mx:Application&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It now works more like a combobox instead of individual buttons. The label will alwys show the button group's selected Value.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working a lot with ItemEditors in DataGrids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the issues I've been dealing with is adding validation to the item editor text entry. I've been attaching my validations to the item editor objects themselves however&amp;nbsp; the Datagrid object throws out ItemEditEnd events. You have to check the event's DataGridReason to see whether it is a cancel or not and then you have the opportunity to validate the data.&amp;nbsp; If the data is bad then do a event.PreventDefault to interrupt the data acceptance and set the target's errorString to the error message.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>C Version of Adobe Flex Policy Server</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2009/02/28/c-version-of-adobe-flex-policy-server/"/>
   <updated>2009-02-28T07:54:10-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2009/02/28/c-version-of-adobe-flex-policy-server</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is a rewrite of the adobe flex policy server written in C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlantageek.com/?attachment_id=74&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-74&quot; title=&quot;FlexPolicyServer&quot;&gt;FlexPolicyServer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is useful if you are adding a flex based web interface to an embedded system (something running openwrt). You can use this policy server instead of the ones written in perl and python.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MINI SA from dunehaven</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2009/02/07/mini-sa-from-dunehaven/"/>
   <updated>2009-02-07T01:01:14-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2009/02/07/mini-sa-from-dunehaven</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got a mini SA board from dunehven.com. My goal was to write a flex UI for a spectrum analyzer. Somr ething I've done at work but unable to demo or discuss. So I've been looking for a cheap spectrum analyzer to supply the  rf data.  I've been considering a wi-spy but am unable to bring myself to buying a $200 device for this project.  Ebay never gave me joy on finding a cheaper model.  I've bidded on 2 or 3 models bug gave up at 120 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found the MiniSA for $50 at dunehaven.  Just from the specs it looks like it is better than the Wi-spy.  However it is a little bit bulkier because in addition to the $50 SA you must buy a open source .Arduino board (~40). I like this solution better because I wanted to get into the AVR microcontrollers anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions of the MINISA is that the  software is pretty minimal compared to what I've seen Wi-spy does.  Wi-spy gives you templates, Spectrum screen, waterfall graphs, statistical displays and all sorts of daemon software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MiniSA's windows only client is a minimal Spectrum screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other  problem is that minisa's usb protocol is not documented. I have email out to the designer hoping he will give me some info.  Until then I might try my hand at some USB snooping.&lt;/p&gt;

His thesis is that you should only outsource the the initial version or core product.  Once you get into the details where the problem is nolonger simple you need to bring it in house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree and I think this applies to outsourced development even when it is a division of the same company.  When the designers and requirement gathers are far away from the developers you are asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Proposed policy. Get rid of the Drug Micro Monopoly.</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/10/18/proposed-policy-get-rid-of-the-drug-micro-monopoly/"/>
   <updated>2008-10-18T14:49:51-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/10/18/proposed-policy-get-rid-of-the-drug-micro-monopoly</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require multiple suppliers for any FDA approved drugs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like a no brainer to me. One of our problems in the US is the expense of drugs. In other countries with more comprehensive government supplied health care there are price controls. In this country it is considered anti-capitalist to be involved with price controls to the point that our sitting president has not given medicare the right to negotiate lower prices directly with drug companies. The US pays more for drugs than other industrialized nations and thus subsidize drug development that other countries benefit from. The government is already involved by giving drug companies temporary monopolies through our patent system. And without this government involvment their industry would collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course drug companies say that they have to do a lot of research to get even one&amp;nbsp; sucessful drug on the market.&amp;nbsp; So they need these temporary monopolies to get a decent return on investment.&amp;nbsp; However there is no way for the markets to determine a fair price because a consumer expects their insurance company to pay whatever it takes to keep them alive.&amp;nbsp; The status-quo is not unacceptable. Between the micro monopolies and the third party payer system the markets do not have room to operate properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would require multiple suppliers for each drug that gets FDA approval. The research company could auction off rights to manufacture/sell their drug to two other companies so there would be at least three suppliers. This would allow the drug research company to recover some of their investment quickly and industry experts (the researcher's competitors) should be able to determine the proper value of the drug during the auction phase. We would have to be careful of collusion. (Three companies always buying each others patents but never manufacturing their partner's drugs). But the situation should be no worse than what we have now and should be a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tools to develop flex on linux</title>

   <updated>2008-09-11T07:35:10-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/09/11/tools-to-develop-flex-on-linux</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to write a debug log when developing flex. The best way to do that in linux is first configure your ~/mm.cfg file with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ErrorReportingEnable=1
TraceOutputFileEnable=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then either use the flash player debug plugin or use the standalone debug player.  I prefer the standalone because I can launch it from the command line right after a successful mxmlc compile. Both are in the tar file &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/9/flash_player_9_linux_dev.tar.gz&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The log will by default be written at
~/.macromedia/Flash_Player/Logs/flashlog.txt
And no this is current as of 2008-9-11, well after the macromedia/adobe merge.  Adobe just hasnt bothered changing the path yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Hidden Knowledge Mangement system.</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/09/07/the-hidden-knowledgemangement-system/"/>
   <updated>2008-09-07T22:19:02-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/09/07/the-hidden-knowledgemangement-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently read Datawocky's article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/2008/07/stop-email-overload-and-break-silos-using-wikis-blogs-and-im.html&quot;&gt;Replacing Email with blogs, wikis and IM&lt;/a&gt;. Its has some good ideas however the devil is in the details. The advantage of email is that it is convenient for the creator. If it is not convenient for the creator then they are less likely to create/send the data. It might be correct that the 3 system approach would be easier to retrieve data but if it reduces the amount of electronic data then it only hurts the communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a better approach would be to have special email addresses that automatically publish the content and responses of the emails themselves. We see this for mailing lists on the internet today. Any email written to low level groups in your organization could be published to an internal website.
However this does not solve the multiple document revisions being passed back and forth over email problem. To handle documents that are passed back and forth I would argue that better group editing tools would be better such as google docs but for the intranet company. Nobody likes downloading documents to their local machine unless they are taking it off line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little scripting on the email server side could eliminate this issue. Whenever a document is emailed out it could be replaced with a link to an editing tool with the document saved on the server side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this companies should be smart about how they define email addresses. People on the helpdesk should not their person specific email address to customers. Instead they should give a generic email address that can be reassigned to someone else after the original person leaves for a new job. How oftern have you used your email as a datastore. A person that has been with the company for a decade probably keeps a significant amout of his information in his email. A resource a lot of people never look at after the original person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just came back from a competitive bidding event. My company was one of the 5 suppliers that were bidding on replacing the customers test equipment with our equipment. We interviewed everyone from the guys in the back office to the guys in the field and the interviewees scored us on the types of questions we asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One item that came up was knowledge management. The customer is generating a huge amout of data, but there is no way for them to compare test results from one customer to the other. Or to compare data from different vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a great opportunity here for someone to leverage these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/08/27/flashplayertrust-on-gnulinux</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was getting Security Sandbox violations in my flash log. I was trying to read a local file and to connect to the network. This is for development reasons only. The final version is all web. Anyway to resolve this on my linux system I created a file with the top level paths that ended in .cfg. You can place  the file in the dir: /home/{user}/.macromedia/Flash_Player/#Security/FlashPlayerTrust directory.
For this to affect all users you put it in this directory.
/etc/adobe/FlashPlayerTrust/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file could be as simple as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
/home/{user}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file should contain a list of top level paths you want the flash player to be able to find. As long as the file ends in .cfg you should be able to use any file name.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm trying to figure out how I can keep the books.The Class rocked.  I was inspired by some of the stuff with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR&amp;amp;topic_id=1&quot;&gt;SparkLines&lt;/a&gt; Got some great ideas for the Dashboard design that we've been struggling with. Also learned a few other things. Edward Tufte hates Microsoft, loves the iphone and thinks that a handout beats powerpoint any day. I have to admit he made some great points. For instance.1. Data Throughput is slow during Powerpoint presentations2. Handouts that are engrossing are a good thing. Even if the audience ignores you.3. Handouts can sit there for hours while a powerpoint is on display for only a few minutes.  And what better way to unsurp your competitor than by giving the potential client something to read during the competitors boring presentation.Other things I learned. Minimize space dedicated to controls. I must have known this already.  I love VI editor because there is little space dedicated to controls.  Its all about the content.  Where as on most IDEs you are luck to get 25% of the screen used for editing code. Hell on this entry form my text box is luck to be 15% of the screen. So I'll look for ways to hide controls.That is the Gist of what I learned. I truly enjoyed this class and I should have taken it a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A small trick when developing flex code that talks to hosting server</title>

   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/03/21/a-small-trick-when-developing-flex-code-that-talks-to-hosting-server</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I often develop my flex code on a machine that is not running a web server. So I have to hardcode the IP of a working server when I need to pull data from the hosting server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a pain because before you checkin the code you have to remember to change the method of pulling the IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my solution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
   var domain:String=mx.utils.URLUtil.getServerName(url);
  var port_nbr:int=mx.utils.URLUtil.getPort(url);
 if (flash.system.Security.sandboxType == &quot;localTrusted&quot;)
  {
    Alert.show(&quot;In Development mode:&quot;+domain+&quot;,&quot;+port);
    webService.wsdl=&quot;http://10.0.0.60:3000/services/wsdl&quot;;
  }
  else
  {
     webService.wsdl=&quot;http://&quot;+domain+&quot;:&quot;+port+&quot;/services/wsdl&quot;;
  }&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is for web services but this technique can be used for sockets as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/03/14/never-buy-a-dell-again</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'll never buy a dell again. My wife shopped for a computer and chose the Dell M1330 last December. Around Feburary the hard drive failed. After replacing the hard drive and reinstalling Windows Vista the machine was unstable. We've had two technicians to come out to repair it.  We've sent it to the Depot. We've spent 20 hours working on this thing.  It is still failing. We've asked  for a new computer.  They say that they've replaced so much hardware that it is literally a new computer.  That's not the point.  Obviously they are missing something.  These machines are working fine from the factory but can't handle a simple Vista reinstall.  I'm not the only one with these problems with these machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=206587&amp;amp;page=3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure this is part of the Vista madness that is going on. However If I had purchased a mac that I could dual boot I'm sure that apple would have made things right. They would have refunded my money or given me a different machine.  Or at least I could have installed Linux on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer service is horrible. We've spent more time repairing, reinstalling, using the computer and then it failing that Dell should have worked with us. But they refused too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice. If you do buy a machine and it starts acting up within 2 months of purchase then suspend the payment on your credit card until its fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>SNMP and Ruby</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/02/27/snmp-and-ruby/"/>
   <updated>2008-02-27T13:19:20-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/02/27/snmp-and-ruby</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working with SNMP can be challenging. If you are a Newbie to SNMP and are trying to do something a little unusual (Writing a Ruby agent that sends snmp traps) you probably have trouble finding examples.  So I've been fighting SNMP for a few days and here are some notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start writing ruby code make sure you can send and recieve snmp messages. In my case I was working with traps.  This is how I got it working in Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Install net-snmp (This is the snmp library and its daemons.) also install net-snmp-utils which is a lot of the command line tool. On Ubuntu &lt;code&gt; apt-get install net-snmp ; apt-get install net-snmp-utils&lt;/code&gt; should work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On Ubuntu the /etc/default/snmpd file overrides a lot of the default snmp settings.  On my version the SNMPDOPTS variable included '127.0.0.1' as the address list.  You can just remove this if you want to recieve snmp traps from other servers.  Also change 'TRAPDRUN' to 'yes'.  This will start snmptrapd daemon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Try the following command.&lt;code&gt;snmptrap -v 1 -c public localhost 1.3.6.1.4.1.10300.1.1.1.12 localhost 3 0 ''&lt;/code&gt; This should work.  We are not using any mibs. Something should be written to your /var/log/syslog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you still have trouble with snmp you can use tcpdump to make sure you are getting a udp message on port 162. I won't get into that.  Its just a sanity check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the ruby code.  To send a version 1 message from ruby you need the snmp gem.  So do your 'gem install snmp'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sample code to do the same call&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

require 'snmp'
SNMP::Manager.open(:Host =&gt; &quot;localhost&quot;,:Version =&gt; :SNMPv1) do |snmp|
x=snmp.trap_v1(
&quot;1.3.6.1.4.1.10300.1.1.1.12&quot;,
'localhost',
:enterpriseSpecific, #Generic Trap Type
0,1234
)

end
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice the :Host key in the Manager object. This is the address of the manager that you want to send the snmp message to.  The localhost in the parameters is the ip or domain name of the agent that is sending the trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some quick notes mostly for myself and for others who get stuck.  It is probably not enough but there are so few examples of this out there on the net it should be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sun Buys Mysql</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/01/16/sun-buys-mysql/"/>
   <updated>2008-01-16T09:38:44-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/01/16/sun-buys-mysql</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Excellent news. Sun acquires Mysql.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/sun-acquires-mysql.html/&quot;&gt;MySQL AB :: Kaj Arn&amp;ouml;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Reasons why Sun bought MySQL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: Sun has seen its technology base crumble with the rise of Microsoft on the enterprise site and Linux on the Anti-Microsoft side. They're getting their ass kicked.  Java has helped them slow their decline but even there they are not the only Java tool shop in town. Now with MySQL they have a chance.  A while back they did a deal with Oracle where they sold a DB appliance with Oracle being the DB. I never saw one being used but it seemed like a great concept.  The problem with these DBs is that they are a pain in the ass to tune to your hardware.  With the appliance the DB will already be tuned to the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second Sun gets to capitalize on its enterprise good name.  MySQL is an excellent product but risk averse companies do not consider it an option. With sun's name behind MySQL it will get an air of legitimacy.  So Sun gets to add value to MySQL with very little effort and gets to reap the rewards of the legitimacy with little effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last of all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun gets it sales force back in the Web based companies contact list. All these companies trying to be corporate citizens are sending Sun their $500 to pay for MySQL and while they are on the phone they get to hear about Sun's new hardware lineup.  Really when was the last time you went to Sun instead of Dell for your web server needs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got this book a few days ago and I'm not really that impressed.  It seems it is focusing on a Java tool called 'Processing' that. He spends more time on how to write code for this tool than on designing data visualization interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unfortunate, I was hoping for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=JNoBAAAACAAJ&amp;amp;dq=inauthor:Edward+inauthor:R+inauthor:Tufte&amp;amp;ei=RwGHR_67Go307QL0vJyVBg&quot;&gt;Tufte &lt;/a&gt;type book updated to the interactive environment we have today. That would be something useful. Instead I get a tool manual.  I still have 2/3 of the book left.  Hopefully it improves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/01/03/zeds-rant</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just read Zed's rant. (Zed is the developer of Mongrel, a recent &amp;amp; popular web server written in Ruby)  Interesting stuff. Not just because he obviously has an Axe to grind but he does give a look at all the stuff going on behind the scenes with Ruby and Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One item that caught my interest was the assertion that Japanese developers ignoring patch submissions from developers. Ruby does have some major performance issues. There is a reason there are at least 2 virtual machines (Rubinus and JRuby) being developed to compete with the current Ruby. And I do wonder if part of the problem is the (spoken) language barrier between the core team and a good chunk of the user market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is time for the language to branch.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Elements of online Journalism</title>
   <link href="http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/01/03/the-elements-of-online-journalism/"/>
   <updated>2008-01-03T00:19:41-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.atlantageek.com/2008/01/03/the-elements-of-online-journalism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the fringe benefits of married life is having someone to get you those Christmas gifts you can't bring your self to buy. And for me those gifts are books. And the week between Christmas and New Year is the best time to read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my books is &quot;The Elements of Online Journalism&quot;  by Rey G. Rosales. Its a nice little overpriced pamphlet of a book topping off at 50 pages. Its targeted to existing journalist who are interested in online journalism. Rosales suggests that there is more to online journalism than just reprinting new paper articles and photos. He talks a lot about flash animations that allow the reader to view and explore data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the type of stuff I'm interested in. Why aren't there more examples of this out there. There are a few apps out there that do a good job of this. For the last presidential election one newspaper generate a flash animation that let you play what if scenarios with the electoral college. The app would categorize states in to 5 groups depending on how likely Bush or Kerry was to win the state with an undecided group right in the middle.  The user could assign electoral votes to one president or another and see how close the candidate was winning. A use could get a much better understanding of the race than any news paper article could give them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why are there not more of these animations.  Where is the animation showing the time line of the Iraq and Afghanistan war. Or showing how the housing boom busted. Why is there not a company that all it does is generate these animations and then rent or sell them to newspapers and other media outlets. A few mentions on Slashdot or digg should pay for the operating cost of a couple of Indian programmers and a couple of guys in the states designing and selling the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two more books to read &quot;Flash Journalism&quot; by Mindy McAdams and Visualizing Data by Ben Fry.  Flash Journalism gives more examples of the journalistic flash animations mentioned above. Visualizing data is about communicating data with graphs.  Another excellent read.&lt;/p&gt;
